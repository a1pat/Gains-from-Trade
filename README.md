# Gains-from-Trade
An Excel spreadsheet showing how trade can benefit both parties (a teaching tool for microeconomics).

Frank and Amy spend their time mining emeralds and rubies. Each has a Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF).
When they do not trade with each other, Frank and Amy are both limited to consuming their own production (efficient production).
When they trade emeralds for rubies with each other, eacch can (in certain scenarios) consume more rubies AND more emeralds than each can produce.

The spreadsheet allows the user to experiment with the following to find out when both parties can gain and when they cannot:
1. Portion of time that Frank and Amy spend producing emeralds when they do not trade - yellow cells.
2. The number of rubies traded for emeralds (which also determines the trade price) - orange cells.

Download the spreadsheet and run it on your computer.
